# The River

The River is a subtractive/fm-based synthesizer with 3
oscillators, a color-variant noise generator, a pitch slider with
a variable-destination envelope, an analogue-style
lowpass/bandpass filter, a loudness envelope, a "tank-style"
reverb with unique features, and a physical-modeling-based
cabinet module. It's designed to produce a wide range of "synthy"
sounds while keeping a distinctive character.
